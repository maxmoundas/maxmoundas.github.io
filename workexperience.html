					<h2>Vanderbilt University's Institute for Software Integrated Systems: AI Engineer</h2>
					<p>May 2023 - Present</p>
				</header>
				<p>After graduation, I joined the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University as
					a
					Generative AI Engineer. I've been working alongside globally-leading AI expert Jules White on
					Vanderbilt's
					Future of Learning and Generative AI initiative. My key contributions include:</p>
				<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
					<ul>
						<li><b>Amplify Development:</b> Led development as one of four engineers on Amplify, an
							open-source
							enterprise generative AI platform adopted by 10+ universities, scaling to 18,000+ users with
							remarkably efficient cost management of $3 per user monthly average.</li>

						<li><b>System Architecture:</b> Designed and implemented critical Amplify features including
							memory
							systems, a novel RAG Fusion system, API integration, artifact generation, and comprehensive
							admin
							monitoring tools.</li>

						<li><b>Leadership and Training:</b> Provided technical leadership through workshops and training
							sessions for faculty and staff, including personal AI coaching for Vanderbilt's Chancellor
							Daniel
							Diermeier.</li>

						<li><b>Research Funding:</b> Successfully secured Phase 1 DARPA grant ($100K) for cybersecurity
							visualization applications using LLMs.</li>

						<li><b>Publications:</b> Authored and co-authored multiple research papers on prompt engineering
							and the
							capabilities of LLMs in software development, including "Prompt Patterns for Structured Data
							Extraction from Unstructured Text" (2025) and "Advancing Generative AI in Software
							Development:
							Evaluating LLM-Generated Code Against Top Human Solutions" (2024).</li>

						<li><b>Presentations:</b> Presented Vanderbilt's generative AI initiatives at Notre Dame's 2024
							AI
							Forum.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>In this role, I continue to explore cutting-edge applications of generative AI across academic,
					research, and
					operational domains, implementing real-world solutions that demonstrate the practical value of these
					technologies.</p>

					<h2>Aimbridge Hospitality: IT Intern</h2>
					<p>May 2021 - August 2023</p>
				</header>
				<p>During my time at Aimbridge Hospitality, a leading third-party hotel management company, I led
					several
					impactful projects focusing on infrastructure optimization and automation:</p>
				<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
					<ul>
						<li><b>License Optimization:</b> Developed PowerShell scripts to identify and eliminate $138,000
							worth
							of unnecessary annual Microsoft licenses.</li>

						<li><b>Active Directory Redesign:</b> Redesigned the Active Directory structure for 20,000 users
							across
							1,500 hotel properties and restructured the assignment of $2,000,000 in annual Microsoft
							license
							bills using PowerShell scripts, consolidating ten Microsoft Active Directory Domains into
							two
							streamlined structures.</li>

						<li><b>Communication System Automation:</b> Leveraged SQL jobs to transform a manual email
							distribution
							list system with 450,000 employee records into an automated Dynamic Distribution Group
							system.</li>

						<li><b>Department Automation:</b> Created custom automation solutions for the legal, finance,
							and
							accounting departments, significantly reducing manual workload and improving operational
							efficiency.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>My work at Aimbridge provided real-world experience in enterprise IT infrastructure management and
					business
					process automation, allowing me to develop practical skills while delivering substantial cost
					savings and
					operational improvements.</p>

					<h3>Summer 2021</h3>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AimbridgeSummer1Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my first
					summer
					internship with Aimbridge, I developed a <b>Dynamic Distribution Group system</b> using
					<b>PowerShell</b>
					scripts alongside <b>SQL jobs</b> to automate internal communications. This system was crucial for
					ensuring
					that Aimbridge's tens of thousands of employees, including senior executives, received critical
					messages
					reliably.
				</p>
				<p>The system eliminated communication issues and ensured timely internal communications while
					identifying and
					removing unnecessary Microsoft licenses, resulting in substantial cost savings.</p>
				<p>Roy Mellinger, Global CISO and VP Security, Privacy, IT Risk and Compliance at Aimbridge Hospitality
					said:
				</p>
				<blockquote>"From day one, Max was part of the IT Team and was assigned important, mission critical
					projects to
					complete. These projects not only helped him learn and hone his technology skills, they also
					provided
					important value to Aimbridge, and resulted in $150,000 in savings."</blockquote>

					<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In my second summer at Aimbridge, I developed a system to automate the distribution of Microsoft
					Office 365
					licenses to <b>1,500 hotel properties</b> using <b>PowerShell</b> scripts and reorganization of
					Aimbridge's
					<b>Active Directory</b>.
				</p>
				<p>This system eliminated billing errors and streamlined license management, ensuring that over <b>$2
						million</b> in annual license fees were properly allocated and billed to the correct properties.
					By
					consolidating multiple Active Directory domains and implementing automated license management, we
					achieved
					significant improvements in operational efficiency and cost tracking.</p>
