										<p>May 2021 - Present</p>
									</header>
									<p>I have had the privilege of working for Aimbridge Hospitality, a highly respected third-party hotel management company. As an IT Intern within Aimbridge's IT department, I have been able to put my technical skills to use in meaningful and impactful ways. One of my key responsibilities has been to create scripts and automate tasks for the company, which has enabled the organization to operate more efficiently and effectively.</p>
									<p>Over the course of two summer internships and ongoing part-time work during the school year, I have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge in maintaining the systems I created and writing scripts for the legal and accounting departments. This has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities facing the hospitality industry, and I have been able to apply my technical skills to address these challenges in innovative and effective ways.</p>
									<p>Working for Aimbridge Hospitality has been a truly transformative experience for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the success of this highly respected organization. I am confident that the skills and experience I have gained through this internship will serve me well in any future role within the technology sector, and I look forward to continuing to build my skills and knowledge as a software developer.</p>

										<h3>Summer 2021</h3>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AimbridgeSummer1Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my first summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a major project that had a significant impact on the company's internal communications system. Specifically, I developed a <b>Dynamic Distribution Group system</b> that uses <b>PowerShell</b> scripts alongside <b>SQL jobs</b> to automate internal communications within the organization. This system was critical in ensuring that Aimbridge's tens of thousands of employees, including senior executives, were receiving critical messages on a regular basis.</p>
									<p>One of the key benefits of this project was the discovery and elimination of over <b>$150,000</b> in annual unnecessary Microsoft license fees. By streamlining the communication process, we were able to reduce the number of licenses required to support the system, resulting in substantial cost savings for the company.</p>
									<p>This project was a major success, eliminating communication issues and ensuring that Aimbridge's associates receive internal communications when expected. I am proud to have played a key role in this effort, and I believe that my experience with this project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of the importance of effective communication in the workplace. As I continue to grow and develop my skills as a software engineer, I look forward to finding new and innovative ways to improve communication and collaboration within organizations.</p>
									<p>Roy Mellinger, Global CISO and VP Security, Privacy, IT Risk and Compliance at Aimbridge Hospitality said:</p>
									<blockquote>"From day one, Max was part of the IT Team and was assigned important, mission critical projects to complete. These projects not only helped him learn and hone his technology skills, they also provided important value to Aimbridge, and resulted in $150,000 in savings."</blockquote>

										<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
									</header>
									<p>During my second summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a project that had a significant impact on the company's license management process. Specifically, I developed a system that automated the distribution of Microsoft Office 365 licenses to Aimbridge's <b>1,500 hotel properties</b> using <b>PowerShell</b> scripts and organization of Aimbridge's <b>Active Directory</b>.</p>
									<p>This system was critical in eliminating billing errors and ensuring that the accounting system between corporate offices and hotel properties was working properly. The new system streamlined the distribution process and ensured that bills were arriving at the correct properties, which has resulted in significant cost savings for the company.</p>
									<p>By automating the distribution of Office 365 licenses, we were able to properly distribute over <b>$2 million</b> in annual fees, which had previously been a time-consuming and error-prone process. I am proud to have played a key role in this effort, and I believe that my experience with this project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of the importance of effective license management and organization.</p>
									<p>This project was a major success, and I am excited about the prospect of continuing to find new and innovative ways to improve business processes and optimize systems through the use of technology.</p>
