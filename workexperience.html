					<h2>Vanderbilt University's Future of Learning and Generative AI Initiative</h2>
					<p>May 2023 - Present</p>
				</header>
				<p>After graudation, I accepted an opportunity to work alongside Jules White, the Associate Dean of
					Strategic Learning Programs, on Vanderbilt's recently launched Future of Learning and Generative AI
					initiative as a research engineer. Our work focuses on leveraging large language models like ChatGPT 
					to automate software development, training Vanderbilt students and faculty to incorporate generative AI 
					tools into their work, and working on interdisciplinary projects with various departments at the university. 
					As generative AI grows and evolves, so do its uses and best practices. We aim to make Vanderbilt University 
					a leading organization in the field of large language models and prompt engineering.</P>
				<p>I oversee a group of undergraduates and lead numerous projects that involve collaboration across different fields.
					We are currently working on building experimentation platforms to automate the testing and benchmarking of
					various prompt tactics, automated systems for software development and an argumentative paper to
					improve the documentation supplied by American Nursing Association.</p>

					<h2>Aimbrige Hospitality</h2>
					<p>May 2021 - August 2023</p>
				</header>
				<p>I have had the privilege of working for Aimbridge Hospitality, a highly respected third-party hotel
					management company. As an IT Intern within Aimbridge's IT department, I have been able to put my
					technical skills to use in meaningful and impactful ways. One of my key responsibilities has been to
					create scripts and automate tasks for the company, which has enabled the organization to operate
					more efficiently and effectively.</p>
				<p>Over the course of two summer internships and ongoing part-time work during the school year, I have
					gained a wealth of experience and knowledge in maintaining the systems I created and writing scripts
					for the legal and accounting departments. This has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the
					unique challenges and opportunities facing the hospitality industry, and I have been able to apply
					my technical skills to address these challenges in innovative and effective ways.</p>
				<p>Working for Aimbridge Hospitality has been a truly transformative experience for me, and I am
					grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the success of this highly respected
					organization. I am confident that the skills and experience I have gained through this internship
					will serve me well in any future role within the technology sector, and I look forward to continuing
					to build my skills and knowledge as a software developer.</p>

					<h3>Summer 2021</h3>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AimbridgeSummer1Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my first
					summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a major project that had a
					significant impact on the company's internal communications system. Specifically, I developed a
					<b>Dynamic Distribution Group system</b> that uses <b>PowerShell</b> scripts alongside <b>SQL
						jobs</b> to automate internal communications within the organization. This system was critical
					in ensuring that Aimbridge's tens of thousands of employees, including senior executives, were
					receiving critical messages on a regular basis.
				</p>
				<p>One of the key benefits of this project was the discovery and elimination of over <b>$150,000</b> in
					annual unnecessary Microsoft license fees. By streamlining the communication process, we were able
					to reduce the number of licenses required to support the system, resulting in substantial cost
					savings for the company.</p>
				<p>This project was a major success, eliminating communication issues and ensuring that Aimbridge's
					associates receive internal communications when expected. I am proud to have played a key role in
					this effort, and I believe that my experience with this project has helped me to develop a deep
					understanding of the importance of effective communication in the workplace. As I continue to grow
					and develop my skills as a software engineer, I look forward to finding new and innovative ways to
					improve communication and collaboration within organizations.</p>
				<p>Roy Mellinger, Global CISO and VP Security, Privacy, IT Risk and Compliance at Aimbridge Hospitality
					said:</p>
				<blockquote>"From day one, Max was part of the IT Team and was assigned important, mission critical
					projects to complete. These projects not only helped him learn and hone his technology skills, they
					also provided important value to Aimbridge, and resulted in $150,000 in savings."</blockquote>

					<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my second summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a project that
					had a significant impact on the company's license management process. Specifically, I developed a
					system that automated the distribution of Microsoft Office 365 licenses to Aimbridge's <b>1,500
						hotel properties</b> using <b>PowerShell</b> scripts and organization of Aimbridge's <b>Active
						Directory</b>.</p>
				<p>This system was critical in eliminating billing errors and ensuring that the accounting system
					between corporate offices and hotel properties was working properly. The new system streamlined the
					distribution process and ensured that bills were arriving at the correct properties, which has
					resulted in significant cost savings for the company.</p>
				<p>By automating the distribution of Office 365 licenses, we were able to properly distribute over <b>$2
						million</b> in annual fees, which had previously been a time-consuming and error-prone process.
					I am proud to have played a key role in this effort, and I believe that my experience with this
					project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of the importance of effective license
					management and organization.</p>
				<p>This project was a major success, and I am excited about the prospect of continuing to find new and
					innovative ways to improve business processes and optimize systems through the use of technology.
