								<p>For my Senior Computer Science Capstone Project at Vanderbilt University, I had the opportunity to work with three other students to develop a website called RateMyClass. This website, similar to RateMyProfessor, was designed to help Vanderbilt students make informed decisions about the courses they take by providing them with access to reviews of courses.</p>
								<p>We built RateMyClass with JavaScript, Node.js, and Firebase as our database. The website enables students to review Vanderbilt classes, provide feedback on their experiences, and view other students' reviews of classes. These features and tools advise students on which courses to take via a user-friendly and efficient website that is easy to navigate.</p>
								<p>This project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of web development and the importance of providing users with a high-quality user experience. I look forward to continuing to work on projects that improve convenience for users and help users make more informed decisions.</p>

								<p>For my Principles of Software Engineering course at Vanderbilt University, I had the opportunity to work with three other students to develop an iOS application for a local food truck called Acropolis Express. Our goal was to create a user-friendly app that would allow customers to order and pay for their food through their mobile devices, as well as providing them with important information about the food truck's hours and location.</p>
								<p>We built the Acropolis Express app with Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode and FireBase. The app enables customers to view the menu, view the location and hours of the truck, place orders, and pay for orders from anywhere. The app enables employees of the food truck to view and manage orders, as well as update information about the truck's hours, location, and menu data. These features and tools have helped to make the food truck's operations more efficient and streamlined, while also providing customers with a better overall experience.</p>
								<p>This project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of mobile app development and the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces. I look forward to continuing to work on projects that can help to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10LtZN_5JZaKkU7zZ_h1ALImZMbZZ4rfSUXHyV67yvjk/edit?usp=sharing">3D Printed Lego Phone Case</a></h2>

								<p>As part of my Rapid Prototyping class, I had the opportunity to design and print a customized phone case for my iPhone 13 Pro. This project challenged me to apply my creativity and technical skills to develop a functional and unique product. I used the Fusion 360 CAD software to incorporate a Lego brick attachment feature to the back of the case, and I used SuperSlicer to create the g-code file for printing. The phone case was printed using a Voron 300.</p>
								<p>Throughout this project, I had to iterate on the design to address certain issues that arose during the printing process. For example, in the first iteration, I realized that the holes for the phone buttons were not aligned properly. This meant that I had to go back to the drawing board and make modifications to the design before printing again. This iterative process was both challenging and rewarding, as it allowed me to develop my problem-solving and critical thinking skills while also improving the final product. This project was an excellent opportunity to put my technical skills and creativity to the test and produce a unique and functional product.</p>
