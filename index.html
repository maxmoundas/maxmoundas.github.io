					<h2>Vanderbilt University's Institute for Software Integrated Systems: Generative AI Research Engineer</h2>
					<p>May 2023 - Present</p>
				</header>
				<p>After graduation, I accepted an opportunity to work alongside Jules White, the Associate Dean of Strategic
					Learning
					Programs, on Vanderbilt's recently launched Future of Learning and Generative AI initiative as a research
					engineer.
					Since I started in May 2023, I've taken a deep dive into the capabilities and practical applications of
					Large Language
					Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. My journey and contributions can be summarized as
					follows:</P>
				<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
					<ul>
						<li><b>Experimentation with LLMs:</b> Through multiple experiments, I've explored the ability of LLMs to
							generate full-stack software applications, to
							accurately assess the runtime performance of different code samples, and to consistently produce
							desired text for
							automated systems.</li>
						<li><b>Automated Incident Response Plan:</b> In collaboration with Vanderbilt CISO, Shane Callahan,
							we've pioneered the development of an LLM-based automated
							incident response plan generator. This initiative is aimed at bolstering security responsiveness
							using generative AI.</li>
						<li><b>Tutoring the University Chancellor:</b> I have had the unique opportunity to personally educate
							and advise Vanderbilt Chancellor, Daniel Diermeier, on the
							potential and applications of LLMs and generative AI tools. This has ensured a top-down
							understanding of the
							transformative power of AI within the institution.</li>
						<li><b>Experimentation Platforms:</b> Recognizing the need for streamlined testing processes, I have
							spearheaded the development of experimentation platforms.
							These platforms play a critical role in automating the testing and benchmarking of various prompt
							engineering
							strategies.</li>
						<li><b>Research and Publication:</b> My curiosity has fueled various research papers, both as an author
							and co-author, where we delve deep into the potential
							of LLMs for streamlining and automating software development processes. My most recent paper on
							<a
								href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ChatGPT_vs__Stack_Overflow_Performance_5pgs.pdf">
								Prompt Engineering of ChatGPT to Improve Generated Code and Runtime Performance Compared with
								the Top-Voted Human Solutions</a> was published in August 2023.
						</li>
						<li><b>University Advising:</b> I've taken on the responsibility of advising Vanderbilt University
							professors and faculty on the best practices for
							harnessing LLMs, especially in a teaching environment. This advising includes writing internal
							communications and
							research papers on the best applications of LLMs for educators.</li>
						<li><b>Collaborative Ventures:</b> My expertise has been sought across various departments, resulting in
							multidisciplinary projects. I've worked closely
							with teams at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the Vanderbilt University IT department, and
							projects associated
							with the National Security Agency to ensure that AI is used optimally across different sectors.</li>
						<li><b>Team Leadership:</b> As part of my responsibilities, I've had the privilege of managing a dynamic
							team of eight undergraduates. Their hard
							work and dedication has been extremely helpful in completing projects and expanding the scope of
							multiple ventures.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>As generative AI grows and evolves, so do its uses and best practices. In every capacity, my aim remains the
					same: to harness the capabilities of generative AI for the betterment of our
					academic, research, and operational endeavors.</p>

					<h2>Aimbrige Hospitality: IT Intern</h2>
					<p>May 2021 - August 2023</p>
				</header>
				<p>I have had the privilege of working for Aimbridge Hospitality, a highly respected third-party hotel
					management company. As an IT Intern within Aimbridge's IT department, I have been able to put my
					technical skills to use in meaningful and impactful ways. One of my key responsibilities has been to
					create scripts and automate tasks for the company, which has enabled the organization to operate
					more efficiently and effectively.</p>
				<p>Over the course of two summer internships and ongoing part-time work during the school year, I have
					gained a wealth of experience and knowledge in maintaining the systems I created and writing scripts
					for the legal and accounting departments. This has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the
					unique challenges and opportunities facing the hospitality industry, and I have been able to apply
					my technical skills to address these challenges in innovative and effective ways.</p>
				<p>Working for Aimbridge Hospitality has been a truly transformative experience for me, and I am
					grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the success of this highly respected
					organization. I am confident that the skills and experience I have gained through this internship
					will serve me well in any future role within the technology sector, and I look forward to continuing
					to build my skills and knowledge as a software developer.</p>

					<h3>Summer 2021</h3>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AimbridgeSummer1Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my first
					summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a major project that had a
					significant impact on the company's internal communications system. Specifically, I developed a
					<b>Dynamic Distribution Group system</b> that uses <b>PowerShell</b> scripts alongside <b>SQL
						jobs</b> to automate internal communications within the organization. This system was critical
					in ensuring that Aimbridge's tens of thousands of employees, including senior executives, were
					receiving critical messages on a regular basis.
				</p>
				<p>One of the key benefits of this project was the discovery and elimination of over <b>$150,000</b> in
					annual unnecessary Microsoft license fees. By streamlining the communication process, we were able
					to reduce the number of licenses required to support the system, resulting in substantial cost
					savings for the company.</p>
				<p>This project was a major success, eliminating communication issues and ensuring that Aimbridge's
					associates receive internal communications when expected. I am proud to have played a key role in
					this effort, and I believe that my experience with this project has helped me to develop a deep
					understanding of the importance of effective communication in the workplace. As I continue to grow
					and develop my skills as a software engineer, I look forward to finding new and innovative ways to
					improve communication and collaboration within organizations.</p>
				<p>Roy Mellinger, Global CISO and VP Security, Privacy, IT Risk and Compliance at Aimbridge Hospitality
					said:</p>
				<blockquote>"From day one, Max was part of the IT Team and was assigned important, mission critical
					projects to complete. These projects not only helped him learn and hone his technology skills, they
					also provided important value to Aimbridge, and resulted in $150,000 in savings."</blockquote>

					<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During my second summer internship with Aimbridge, I had the opportunity to work on a project that
					had a significant impact on the company's license management process. Specifically, I developed a
					system that automated the distribution of Microsoft Office 365 licenses to Aimbridge's <b>1,500
						hotel properties</b> using <b>PowerShell</b> scripts and organization of Aimbridge's <b>Active
						Directory</b>.</p>
				<p>This system was critical in eliminating billing errors and ensuring that the accounting system
					between corporate offices and hotel properties was working properly. The new system streamlined the
					distribution process and ensured that bills were arriving at the correct properties, which has
					resulted in significant cost savings for the company.</p>
				<p>By automating the distribution of Office 365 licenses, we were able to properly distribute over <b>$2
						million</b> in annual fees, which had previously been a time-consuming and error-prone process.
					I am proud to have played a key role in this effort, and I believe that my experience with this
					project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of the importance of effective license
					management and organization.</p>
				<p>This project was a major success, and I am excited about the prospect of continuing to find new and
					innovative ways to improve business processes and optimize systems through the use of technology.
