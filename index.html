								<p>For my Senior Computer Science Capstone Project at Vanderbilt University, I had the opportunity to work with three other students to develop a website called RateMyClass. This website, similar to RateMyProfessor, was designed to help Vanderbilt students make informed decisions about the courses they take by providing them with access to reviews of courses.</p>
								<p>We built RateMyClass with JavaScript, Node.js, and Firebase as our database. The website enables students to review Vanderbilt classes, provide feedback on their experiences, and view other students' reviews of classes. These features and tools empower students to make more informed decisions about which courses to take on a user-friendly and efficient website that is easy to navigate.</p>
								<p>This project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of web development and the importance of providing users with a high-quality user experience. I look forward to continuing to work on projects that improve convenience for users and help users make more informed decisions.</p>

								<p>For my Principles of Software Engineering course at Vanderbilt University, I had the opportunity to work with three other students to develop an iOS application for a local food truck called Acropolis Express. Our goal was to create a user-friendly app that would allow customers to order and pay for their food through their mobile devices, as well as providing them with important information about the food truck's hours and location.</p>
								<p>We built the Acropolis Express app with Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode and FireBase. The app enables customers to view the menu, view the location and hours of the truck, place orders, and pay for orders from anywhere. The app enables employees of the food truck to view and manage orders, as well as update information about the truck's hours, location, and menu data. These features and tools have helped to make the food truck's operations more efficient and streamlined, while also providing customers with a better overall experience.</p>
								<p>This project has helped me to develop a deep understanding of mobile app development and the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces. I look forward to continuing to work on projects that can help to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.</p>
