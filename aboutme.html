					As a Generative AI Engineer at Vanderbilt's Institute for Software Integrated Systems, I lead the
					development of Amplify,
					an open-source enterprise AI platform that serves over 18,000 users across multiple universities.
					Working alongside globally-leading
					AI expert Jules White, I architect and implement innovative features including memory systems, RAG
					Fusion systems, and advanced
					monitoring tools. My role extends beyond technical development to include providing AI leadership
					through workshops and training
					sessions, including personal AI coaching for Vanderbilt's Chancellor.</p>
				<p>My journey in technology began during my time at Vanderbilt University, where I combined rigorous
					academic work with practical
					experience. As an IT Intern at Aimbridge Hospitality, I demonstrated my ability to tackle complex
					enterprise challenges by
					developing automation solutions that saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.
					This experience taught me
					the importance of creating scalable, efficient solutions that deliver real business value.</p>
				<p>I am also actively involved in advancing the field of AI through research and publications. As a
					primary author and co-author
					of multiple papers focusing on LLM capabilities and prompt engineering, I contribute to the growing
					body of knowledge in AI
					and software engineering. My research has been recognized through successful grant acquisitions,
					including a Phase 1 DARPA
					grant for cybersecurity visualization applications using LLMs.</p>
				<p>I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI technology while ensuring its
					practical application in
					enterprise settings. Whether developing new AI systems, conducting research, or mentoring others, I
					remain committed to
					creating solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>
